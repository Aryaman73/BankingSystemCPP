# Banking Management System (Turbo C++)

This is a C++ Project I had made using MS-DOS/Turbo C++ during my final year of High School. Turbo C++ is fairly dated, but it was still a lot of fun trying to make it look usable and interesting. Along with that, it actually makes use of quite a bit of binary and text file handling.

This program is meant to simulate a Banking System for both the Customer and Bank Employees. The program works on a .dat binary file which stores the information about the customers, and a combination of a .dat and .txt file which stores transaction records.
 
Through the Server module, one can:
 - Create new records
 - Display all records, or display following a certain criteria.
 - Delete record
 - Update records
 - View All Transactions that have taken place in the bank.
 
Through the Customer module, one can:
 - View Details of the Customer
 - Withdraw or Deposit Money, and earn points for the same.
 - Redeem the Points for voucher codes.
 - View Transactions done by customer
 
Account Security: Each Customer has an Account No. as well as a PIN, through which they must login. The pin is randomly assigned at the point of Account Creation.

Reward Point System: The customer earns points by doing transactions (withdrawal/deposits). These points can be redeemed for Voucher Codes, which are randomly generated.

Transaction Ledger: Along with the .dat file, the program also stores all transactions in a .txt file which can be used and edited by the bank as needed.
